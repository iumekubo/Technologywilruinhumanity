			<center><h2>Technology destroys!</h2></center>

			<center><p>Technology is ruining humanity, it has not only been the source of many peoples 
			lives being put into harms way but has ended many of those peoples lives. One piece 
			of technology is known by everyone and has already been known to cause casualties manly 
			death, this device is known as the phone and has distracted the user when driving generally 
			causing them to crash. Another piece of technology that has harmed others is called a nuclear 
			bomb this is a weapon that while it is used to protect us can be used against us and
			can kill anyone or anything. These two pieces of technology already show us that technology is 
			harming humanity badly and that any further and we will be brought to a means of an end.</p>

			<p>	Technology is not only binging the downfall of humanity, but the downfall of the whole world
			the technology we use affects the earth in two various bad ways the first way is pollution. 
			The technology we use has completely polluted the earth and have put its air in a dire state 
			this proves that technology is ruining us already, and should be put to an end. The second way 
			technology has ruined the earth itself, global warming. The technology we use has more then once 
			changed the heat of the earth and has caused the earth to heat up in areas such as Alaska. 
			This shows that technology has time and time again destroyed humanity and the earth and that 
			later down the line will end us. We must raise the awareness of the dangers of technology.</p></center>
